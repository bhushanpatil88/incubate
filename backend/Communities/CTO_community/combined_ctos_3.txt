Amit Verma
CTO at HT Digital | Ex- Microsoft
Delhi, India
Summary
I am the Chief Technology Officer of HT Digital and have over 16
years of experience in engineering leadership, stream processing,
databases, and agile methodologies. I am passionate about building
scalable, reliable, and user-friendly technology solutions that
enhance the digital experience and create value for customers and
stakeholders.
Before joining HT Digital in 2022, I was an Engineering Leader at
Microsoft, where I led the Search Discovery and Playlist crews for
Microsoft Stream, a cloud-based video service that integrates with
Office 365. I was responsible for making videos searchable and
discoverable across the suite and enabling users to organize videos
and audios efficiently using playlists. 
I also worked as the General Manager of Engineering at Paytm,
where I built and managed the next-generation payment gateway
that processed millions of transactions a day, improved the payment
success rate, increased the system availability, and scaled the
payment gateway 8x to handle increased traffic. I have multiple
certifications in Java, interviewing techniques, and performance-
based hiring, and I enjoy mentoring and coaching other engineers
and aspiring leaders.

Summary
Before facing job interview, we always think that whether we are
eligible for particular company or not. Think the reverse way.
Whether the company is eligible for you or not. If the company
has no capability and corporate culture to evaluate your talent or
creativity, don't accept the job offer.
