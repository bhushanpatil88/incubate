Summary
"From Machines to Marketing: Crafting Success at MANUFAST with
a Blend of Engineering and Digital Marketing"
After about 7-8 years of studying Mechanical Engineering, I
got frustrated with the outdated hiring methods in the field. This
frustration led me to explore something new.
In December 2019, I discovered the world of Digital Marketing, which
fascinated me because of the various tools and techniques it offered
to grow a business. Bill Gates' quote, "If your business isn't online,
it's outdated," struck a chord with me.
I started learning Digital Marketing on my own since the available
classes didn't match my expectations. I took online courses on
platforms like Udemy and gained practical knowledge through an
internship at POOINFOTECH. There, I learned about WordPress,
Social Media Marketing, YouTube SEO, and design on Canva.
Later, I joined CKS Engineering Works, a company involved in
Mechanical Sales and Marketing. This job allowed me to blend my
Digital Marketing skills with Sales techniques. However, my desire to
create something unique led me to leave CKS.
With my friends Shubham and Pradeep, I co-founded MANUFAST.
Here, I serve as the Co-Founder and Chief Marketing Officer,
combining my marketing expertise with Mechanical Engineering
knowledge.
My journey reflects a fusion of different skills and passions, showing
what's possible when diverse interests come together.
