Summary
I've been in the marketing game for over seven years, dabbling in
both B2C and B2B landscapes. Collaboration and creativity are my
jam—I love working with teams and getting stuff done. Whether
it's in a fast-paced multicultural environment or flying solo, I'm all
about making things happen. I've got a knack for teaming up with
folks from different departments, be it product development, digital
marketing, social media, content management, branding, or strategy.
From brainstorming ideas to bringing them to life, I'm all in.
