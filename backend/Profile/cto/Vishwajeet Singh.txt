Summary
Experienced Serial Entrepreneur | Subject Matter Expert for
Atlassian Tools | Agile , DevOps, Project Management, and ALM
Specialist
With a passion for innovation and a track record of success, I
am a serial entrepreneur who has worked extensively in both the
enterprise and consumer spaces. I specialize in leveraging Atlassian
tools such as Jira, Jira Agile, Jira Service Desk, and Confluence
as a subject matter expert, empowering companies of all sizes to
maximize their ROI from their ALM/DevOps tools infrastructure.
Over the past decade, I have honed my expertise in the DevOps,
Project Management, and ALM domains. I have collaborated with
numerous startups, guiding them in implementing best practices and
achieving seamless integration of their development and operations
processes. With a deep understanding of the industry, I have
trained over 1000 professionals on various Atlassian and DevOps
tools, equipping them with the skills to drive efficient workflows and
achieve exceptional results.
Passionate about open source technologies and the potential
they hold, I have dedicated my career to harnessing the power of
Atlassian tools, DevOps, CI/CD, and automation. I have hands-
on experience in coding with Python and Java, having developed
web applications from scratch and created custom integrations and
plugins for Atlassian tools.
Currently, I am excited about the intersection of NLP, AI, and
deep learning with DevOps. My focus lies in exploring innovative
ways to enhance the adoption and overall experience of DevOps
methodologies through cutting-edge technologies. By leveraging
these advancements, I aim to revolutionize the industry and drive
continuous improvement in software development practices.
